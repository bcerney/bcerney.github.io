Hello world! Welcome to the first draft of my new [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)-built personal blog. I followed [Jonathan Klughertz's tutorials](https://www.codeblocq.com/2016/03/Create-an-Hexo-Theme-Part-1-Index/) to create the theme and [James Spurin's tutorial](https://spurin.com/2019/03/10/Creating-a-Blog-with-Hexo-Docker-and-Github-Free-Hosting-and-https/) to setup the Docker/GitHub Pages deployment pipeline; I highly recommend both. More updates coming soon, stay tuned.
