In February [Guitars Not Guns Ohio wrapped up another class](https://www.10tv.com/article/guitars-not-guns-program-aims-help-risk-youth-find-alternative-violence-2020-feb?fbclid=IwAR3PSIKdw-Y81_fROXSYS26aqMyPL0flXmyrpPOmRlCUJJgSeMYp5lo21aQ), this one at [Cassady Elementary School](https://www.ccsoh.us/CassadyES) with [After-School All-Stars](https://www.facebook.com/afterschoolallstars/). The kids did a great job and were very excited to take their guitars home. For now the organization is playing the COVID-19 waiting game like everyone else, but we're looking forward to a return to normalcy and classes starting back up.

After playing a few shows in the fall - including the [Columbus Marathon](https://www.facebook.com/bottleflies/videos/2202086460090369/) - bottleflies turned to focus on writing and recording. We worked on new material through the winter, and were preparing to enter the studio when the Stay At Home order came out. So, with studio recording on pause, we're staying busy by revisiting some DIY recording we did last summer. Hopefully I'll have something to share from those efforts.

In the meantime, I've started learning to play the mandolin after receiving one as a gift - thanks Mom! The instrument has provided a nice challenge and a welcome distraction while the social distancing continues. It's also helped inspire me to revisit some half-written songs I've had sitting on the backburner for a while. Again, hoping to share some recordings soon.
