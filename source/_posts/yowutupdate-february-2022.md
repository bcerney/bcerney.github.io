Lately bottleflies has been focused on recording and songwriting. In September 2020 we released [Blue Period](https://bottleflies.bandcamp.com/album/blue-period) - a DIY album composed of 14 original songs, most of which the band has been playing since before I joined in 2016.

We started recording before COVID hit, and the lull after gave Charlie Boyd - our drummer and lead engineer on the album - the time to mix and release. My guitar parts were recorded using Marill, my trusty ???? Jimmy Vaughn Fender Stratocaster, through a Boss GT-100. My recording process was straightforward - I recorded two takes for each song, and chose the take I preferred; having played these songs for several years now, I knew how I was going to approach them and didn't want to overthink things.

Next up: bottleflies heads to Weird Studios to record a mix of old and new songs

This past fall I served as a Techie Club instructor...
